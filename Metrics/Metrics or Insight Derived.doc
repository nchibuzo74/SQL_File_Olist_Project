This project is based on an E-Commerce firm "Olist".
The object was for the business to track sales performance and how well sales has improved.

The Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) used is PostgreSQL.
I connected PG Admin (Postgres SQL) to VS Code to commit my code and files to a repository in my Github account.
